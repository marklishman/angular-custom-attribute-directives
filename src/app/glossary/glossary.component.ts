      TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed
      and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of
      JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. Anders Hejlsberg,
      lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on
      the development of TypeScript. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript
      applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.
      TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and compiles to
      JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript
      programs are also valid TypeScript programs.`;
